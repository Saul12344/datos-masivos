# Final project

# Introduction.
This is the final evaluation of the subject of massive data, in this practice it is intended to see how effective the learning models are, comparing the memory they use, the time they take to execute and seeing their precision, this will be done with a file csv provided by the teacher that has more than 45,000 data.
The objective of the classification is to predict if the client subscribed a term deposit (variable y) and we try to make a prediction with the models: SVM, decision tree, logistic regression and multilayer perceptron that are machine learning models.


# Theoretical framework of algorithms.

- Decision Three
- Logistic Regression
- Multilayer perceptron
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)


# Support Vector Machine (SVM).

It is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separation hyperplane. In other words, given the labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm generates an optimal hyperplane that categorizes new examples. In two-dimensional spaces, this hyperplane is a line that divides a plane into two parts where each class is on each side. That is used in many classification and regression problems, including medical applications of signal processing, natural language processing, and image and speech recognition. The idea of SVM is simple: the algorithm creates a line or hyperplane that separates the data into classes.

Advantages and disadvantages

Advantage:
- Classifier algorithm based on solid theory. Risk minimization theorems are the state of the art in statistical learning.
- Can be applied to data represented in any Hilbert space (where you can define a distance measure).
- Relatively few parameters to estimate.
- New extensions can be formulated (flexibility).

Disadvantages:
- Determining the kernels to use is complex.
- It is just a binary classifier.

# Decision three classifier (DTC).

A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a graph or model of decisions in the form of a tree and their possible consequences, including outcomes of chance events, resource costs, and utility. It is a way of showing an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements. A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute (for example, whether a coin turns heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision made after calculating all attributes). The root-to-leaf paths represent classification rules.

Advantages and disadvantages


Advantage:
- Decision trees can generate understandable rules.
- Decision trees perform classification without requiring many calculations.
- Decision trees can handle continuous and categorical variables.
- Decision trees provide a clear indication of which fields are most important for prediction or classification.

Disadvantages:

- Decision trees are less appropriate for estimation tasks where the goal is to predict the value of a continuous attribute.
- Decision trees are prone to errors in classification problems with many classes and a relatively small number of training examples.
